# Inception

## Overview

The **Inception** project provides hands-on experience in system administration using Docker within a virtual machine. It covers key aspects of virtualization and containerization, focusing on Docker utilization, configuration management, custom Docker image creation, server management in containers.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Inception project, follow these steps:

## Project Structure

- **`srcs/`**: Contains all project-related Docker configurations and files.
  - **`nginx/`**: Nginx container configuration.
  - **`wordpress/`**: WordPress setup files.
  - **`mariadb/`**: MariaDB configuration and initialization.
- **`.env`**: Environment variables file.
- **`Makefile`**: Used for building images, running containers, stopping containers, and deleting images.

  
1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/inception.git
    cd inception
    ```

2. **Setup Virtual Machine**

    Set up a virtual machine environment to run Docker. You can use tools like VirtualBox or VMware.

3. **Install Docker**

    Install Docker following the official guide for your operating system:
    [Docker Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

4. **Makefile Targets**

    The `Makefile` provides several targets to manage Docker images and containers. Hereâ€™s a brief explanation of each target:
    
    - **`build`**: Builds Docker images using the cache. This is the default behavior and is generally faster but may not incorporate recent changes to   Dockerfiles.
    
    - **`build-no-cache`**: Builds Docker images without using the cache (`--no-cache` option). This ensures that the images are built from scratch and incorporates any recent changes to Dockerfiles or dependencies.
    
    - **`up`**: Starts Docker containers in detached mode. This runs the containers in the background, allowing you to use your terminal for other tasks.
    
    - **`down`**: Stops and removes Docker containers. This cleans up any running containers without deleting the images or volumes.
    
    - **`clean`**: Stops containers, removes images, and deletes volumes. This is a comprehensive cleanup that frees up space and ensures that no residual data is left behind.
    
    - **`rebuild`**: A convenience target that first cleans up by stopping containers and removing images, then rebuilds Docker images without using the cache, and finally restarts the containers. This is useful for ensuring a fresh build environment.
    
    You can run `make build-no-cache` to build your Docker images without using the cache. This might be necessary to ensure that all components are updated properly.


6. **Verify**

    Check the status of running containers:

    ```bash
    docker ps
    ```
