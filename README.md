# Inception

## Overview

The **Inception** project provides hands-on experience in system administration using Docker within a virtual machine. It covers key aspects of virtualization and containerization, focusing on Docker utilization, configuration management, custom Docker image creation, server management in containers, container resilience, user management, domain configuration, and security best practices.

## Project Objectives

- **Docker Utilization**: Learn to deploy and manage Docker containers.
- **Configuration Management**: Implement configurations for performance and security.
- **Custom Docker Images**: Create and manage Docker images tailored to project needs.
- **Server Management**: Run servers in Docker containers, ensuring effective management.
- **Container Resilience**: Ensure containers are resilient and maintain uptime.
- **User Management**: Manage users and permissions within Docker.
- **Domain Configuration**: Configure domains and networking.
- **Security Best Practices**: Apply security measures to protect the Docker environment.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Inception project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/inception.git
    cd inception
    ```

2. **Setup Virtual Machine**

5. **Run the Setup**

    Start Docker containers and ensure all services are running correctly:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

6. **Verify**

    Check the status of running containers:

    ```bash
    docker ps
    ```
